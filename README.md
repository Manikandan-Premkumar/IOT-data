This project simulates an IoT sensor that publishes temperature and humidity data to AWS IoT Core via MQTT. If the temperature exceeds a threshold, an SNS alert is triggered. All data is stored in Amazon S3 using a Lambda function invoked by an IoT Rule.

Architecture

Simulated Sensor (Python script)
        ↓ MQTT
     AWS IoT Core
        ↓ IoT Rule (SQL + Condition)
     AWS Lambda (store payload to S3)
        ↓
     SNS Topic (alert if temperature > 25°C)
        ↓
     Amazon S3 (stores JSON files)

     
Components
